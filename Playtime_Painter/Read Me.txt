Thank you for using Playtime Painter. 

The Asset is being constantly developed and there are many features yet to come. 
If something looks like a bug or just feels unintuitive, feel free to use one of the Contact options below to let me know.


HOW TO USE:
Attach PlaytimePainter Component to the GameObject you want to edit. Component's interface contains all the Texture editing
and mesh editing functionality. More in Online Documentation.

IMPORTANT TO KNOW:
Component more often prioratizes time-saving over being cautious. For example, it will automatically set "Is readable" 
for texture currently selected for editing and will create a .PNG RGBA copy of it to edit if current version is of a wrong format.
I created it for a very specific goal: to try stuff out as fast as possible. It's easy to edit things, but as a result, it's possible
to accidentally do an unwanted change to your Assets. Still, if something like that happens, I'll appreciate the feedback.
Also it's best not to move folders around. Some dependencies are location sensitive (Shader include files, they need to be referenced directly).


Hope you will enjoy the Asset, and please join a Discord channel (link below).
